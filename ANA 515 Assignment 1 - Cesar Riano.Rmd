## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document created for the 1st assignment of the ANA 515 Data Storage class.


```{r, include = FALSE}
#The include = FALSE function hides both the code and output in my output document

#Packages needed: 
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(bslib)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
#this next lines are getting the data from githubb
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/master/full_data.csv"
CR_data <- read_csv(url)
glimpse(CR_data)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
#this next line is creating a subset called 'youth' 
youth <- CR_data %>% 
  filter(age <= 65)
summary(youth)
```
## Analysis

We have data about `r nrow(CR_data)` individuals killed by guns. Only 
`r nrow(CR_data) - nrow(youth)` are older than 65. 
The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

## Gun deaths by age

```{r youth-dist, echo = FALSE}
youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(age)) + 
geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
```

## Gun deaths by race
```{r race-dist, echo = FALSE}
youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race)%>% fct_rev())) + 
  geom_bar() + coord_flip() + 
  labs(x = "Victim race")
```

## Side note

This was very very usefull to keep track of my code. It works kind of like Jupyter notebooks on Python. Thanks for this Anna!
